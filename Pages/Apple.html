<h2>Performa Line</h2>
<p>The Performa line was introduced in 1992 and was produced until 1997. The performa line did not have their own original models, instead reusing existing models from other Macintosh lines such as Quadra, Centris, LC, Classic and Power Macintosh. The comptuers were usually bundled with additional software or bigger hard drives</p>
<p>The line was a complete failure, Unlike traditional Macintosh computers, The performa was not sold through Apple's traditional dealer network, instead, it was sold through big box  stores such as Circuit City and Sears, These units were not taken care of however, and often were malfunctioning or were broken. Apple overestimated the demand for the Performa line. </p>
<p>The line was informally discontinued in 1997, following Steve Job's return to the company, and formally discontinued in 1998, following the company restructuring their product lines. </p>
